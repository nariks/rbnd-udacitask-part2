# What you added to Udacitask 2.0
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. What is the gem of your choice and how did you use it?
	Gem added command_line_reporter - This gem was used to print the list outputs in a table format and using color coding to print all items of same type in a certain color. format_description method removed as command line reporter takes care of formatting the text


2. Describe the 2 features you added to the project.
  a) Change priority of any todo item - Priority of a particular todo item can be changed using the change_priority method. If the item cannot be found an InvalidItemError exception is raised.
  b) Deleting multiple items at the same time. Method uses a splat operator to accept multiple indices for deletion and deletes them accordingly.

# REFLECTIONS
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. How long did you spend working on this project?
	I spent around 5 hours to work on this project
2. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
	The most rewarding challenge to learn how the new gem works and implement it in this project.
3. What two additional features did you build? Why?
	The two additional features built were deleting multiple items at same time and change the priority of list items. These help the list to be a bit more dynamic rather than static.
4. Where do you still have room to grow?
	I think I still room to grow to understand classes and object oriented design in more detail.
